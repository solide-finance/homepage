        details to assist other companies in performing their searches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that the use of your personal information by external third parties who act as data controllers of
        your personal information is not covered by this Privacy Policy and is not subject to our privacy standards and
        procedures.

        Where our use of your personal information requires your consent, such consent will be provided using consent

      </p>
      <h2>HOW DO WE PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>
        We will provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Information and make sure that appropriate
        technical and organisational security measures are in place to protect the Professional Information against
        accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, and
        against all other unlawful forms of processing. We track and maintain strict records for all of our data
        processing activities. We place your account information on the secure portion of our website, using security
        technology to protect our network and systems from external attacks. In addition, if you access information
        online, we use digital certificate services to authenticate that you are transacting with the Platform and not
        an impostor.
      </p>
      <p>
        We always take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that your information is secure. In
        particular, we train our employees who handle personal information to respect the confidentiality of customer
        and user information and the privacy of individuals. We regard breaches of your privacy very seriously and will
        impose appropriate measures, including dismissal where appropriate and necessary.
      </p>
      <h2>HOW DO WE STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION AND FOR HOW LONG?</h2>
      <p>
        Safeguarding the privacy of your personal information is important to us, whether you interact with us
        personally, by phone, by mail, over the internet or any other electronic medium. We hold personal information in
        secure computer storage facilities, cloud servers and paper-based files and other records and take steps to
        protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding the use of cloud servers, we currently use Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS offers customers a number of
        compliance measures they can rely on to comply with Swiss and European data protection laws including the FADP.
        For example, customers are able to rely on the AWS Data Processing Addendum, which includes the European
        Standard Contractual Clauses (the “<b>SCCs</b>”) recognized by the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information
        Commissioner (the “<b>FDPIC</b>”) . The AWS Data Processing Addendum is available to all AWS customers
        transferring data from the EU, Switzerland, or other regions to any of AWS’ infrastructure regions around the
        world, whether in the US or otherwise. The Data Processing Addendum gives customers the assurance that AWS
        applies stringent security, privacy and data protection safeguards aligned with the FADP and the GDPR
        requirements, including provisions for data transfer, data subject rights and breach notifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        AWS customers have granular control over their data they store in the AWS cloud. AWS also enables a high level
        of security and maintains certification with robust security standards, such as ISO 27001, SOC 1/2/3and PCI DSS
        Level 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we consider that personal information is no longer needed, we will remove any details that will identify
        you or we will securely destroy the records. However, we may need to maintain records for a significant period
        of time. For example, we are subject to certain anti-money laundering laws which require us to retain:
        <ul>
          <li>a copy of the documents we used to comply with our customer due diligence obligations; and</li>
          <li>supporting evidence and records of transactions with you and your relationship with us,</li>
        </ul>
        for a period of ten years after our business relationship with you has ended.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we hold any personal information in the form of a contract, we will retain this contract deed in its complete
        form for a period of 10 years after our business relationship with you has ended.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we hold any personal information in the form of a recorded communication, by telephone, electronic, in person
        or otherwise, the retention period of this information will be compliant with local regulatory requirements
        which will either be 5 years or 10 years, subject always to statutory requirements, after our business
        relationship with you has ended.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where you have opted out of receiving marketing communications we will hold your details on a separate
        designated list of persons so that we know you do not want to receive these communications.
      </p>
      <h2>TRANSFERS OUTSIDE OF SWITZERLAND</h2>
      <p>
        We may transfer your personal information outside of Switzerland to the processors who are engaged on our behalf
        (“<b>Transferees</b>”). The Transferees are located in the following countries: France. To the extent we
        transfer your information outside Switzerland, we will ensure that the transfer is lawful and that there are
        appropriate and adequate security arrangements to protect your Personal Information in accordance with
        applicable legal requirements. The Transferees are permitted to use the personal data only for the purposes
        which we have identified, and not for their own purposes, and they are not permitted to further share the data
        without our express permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to transfer personal information to third parties in territories that do not have a finding of adequacy
        by the applicable authority and regulations, we enter into agreements with the Transferees ensuring appropriate
        and suitable safeguards based on the SCCs. Where we make transfers to Transferees in the US, we only transfer
        personal data to entities certified under Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework between Switzerland and the USA. If
        transfers are made to US entities that are not certified under this framework, we ensure that appropriate
        safeguards such as SCCs and binding corporate rules as required by the FADP. If you would like a copy of such
        arrangements, please contact us using the contact details below.
